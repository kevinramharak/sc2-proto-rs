Protocol buffers for the StarCraft II Client API. Automatically generated from the protobuf definitions at
[Blizzard/s2client-proto](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto).

Pre-generated files in `src/` will be compiled by default.
If you want to generate rust code from .proto files, install [protobuf compiler][protoc] and make sure it's in PATH.
Then build this lib with `generate` feature.

Please note that this repository only contains the protobuf definitions, no abstraction is included here.
